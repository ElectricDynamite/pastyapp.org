        <h2>The Answers (and also the questions again)</h2>
        <a name="a1">&nbsp;</a><h3>What is Pasty?</h3>
        <p>Pasty is a collection of applications that, in total, provide a cloud-based clipboard service to help you easily share short snippets over your different devices.
        And it's completely free! Take a look at <a href="index.html">About Pasty</a> for more infos.</p>
        
        <a name="a2">&nbsp;</a><h3>Why is it free?</h3>
        <p>It is free because I like services that are free and hence try to offer all my services for free. Of course I can only do this as long as I can afford it.
        What was that? You wanna help me finance this? Well, isn't that kind of you! Check out the <a href="donations.html">Donations Page</a>.</p>
        
        <a name="a3">&nbsp;</a><h3>What about my data, do you make money using my data?</h3>
        <p>Nope. I don't like services that make money using their users data. Just because I offer you a service to transfer data for you does not
        mean I have any rights to that data.
        It's yours, and it stays that way. The only way I can make money and hence pay for this service is via <a href="donations.html">donations</a>. 
        So if you like Pasty, consider donating a buck or two.</p>
        
        <a name="a4">&nbsp;</a><h3>What clients are there?</h3>
        <p>Currently there is a native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.electricdynamite.pasty">Android app</a>, a rather crude <a href="https://pasty.cc/">Web App</a>, and a GTK client is in work. What I wanna build next is a Mobile Webapp, an Ubuntu client, and a Windows client.</p>
        
        <a name="a5">&nbsp;</a><h3>When will client xyz be released?</h3>
        <p>Considering I do all this in my free time, development can be slow. I always try my best to deliver the clients I deem most important asap.
        But Pasty's API is open, so if you are somebody or know somebody that knows how to code, check out <a href="#a6">&laquo; I am a developer and want a client for xyz.&raquo; </a>.</p>
        
        <a name="a6">&nbsp;</a><h3>I am a developer and want a client for xyz.</h3>
        <p>First of all, that's not a question. Ha, I know, I wrote it myself and now act as if it is your fault. Isn't that funny?
        But enough of teh funnehs, let's get to business. Pasty's API is open, so if you REALLY want that client, why don't you go ahead and write it yourself?
        Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite/pasty-server/wiki" target="_blank">Wiki pages on Github</a>, mostly the <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite/pasty-server/wiki/REST-API" target="_blank">REST API</a>.</p>
        
        <a name="a7">&nbsp;</a><h3>Is Pasty Open Source?</h3>
        <p>Right now, no it isn't. But that is not an issue of closed source vs. open source. I am an 100% open source guy. So Pasty or at least most parts of it being released publically is only a matter of time. You will then find the source on <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite" target="_blank">Github</a>.
          A small part of Pasty is already released as OSS. It is a <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> (Javascript) library that handles API calls to Pasty's API Server. It is used as part of the <a href="https://pasty.cc">Web App</a> it is released under the name pastyclient-node and is available via <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite/pastyclient-node">Github</a> and <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/pastyclient-node">npm</a>.
          It is licensed under <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.
