        <h1>What Pasty can do for you</h1>
        <p>Pasty provides you with a clipboard, just like your computer, tablet or smartphone does. The difference is, that the data is not stored locally on the device, but instead get's stored on Pasty's servers.
        Why should this be of advantage for you? Well, imagine you just got this link for this awesome <a href="http://youtu.be/Y1g2Cx03L2I" target="_blank">Youtube Video</a> on your smartphone,
        and wanna show it to your friends on a big screen. Or you just uploaded one of your great pictures to <a href="http://imgur.com/9wuzk" target="_blank">Imgur</a> on your computer and wanna share it using an App on your Tablet.
        How to you get the URL over to the over device? If you are any like me, you are tired of sending yourself emails containing just a link, or for that matter a bit of text you need on the other device.
        </p>
        <p>This is where Pasty comes running like the hero you needed but did not deserve. <span class="little">(Batman jokes, anyone?)</span><br>
        Just open your Pasty app, or use Pasty's web-app to copy your link into your Pasty Clipboard. Then open Pasty on the other device, copy and just go on with what you really enjoy.
        Pasty is a tool designed to give you more time for the things you like to do, taking as little time as possible for itself. It is almost as if you Copy &amp; Paste between two devices. And the best thing? It is completely free!<br>
        Now go and <a href="https://pastyapp.org/user/create/">create an account</a>! Or do you wanna know even more? Go on reading.

        <h1>So you wanna know even more about Pasty, eh?</h1>
        <p>Sure thing. How about this for a start: Pasty does not care what kind of device you are using! Pasty comes with a <a href="https://pastyapp.org">webinterface</a> that makes it usuable on almost any device that is connected to the internet.
        Also, there are native Pasty apps for different platforms. We start out with an <a href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank">Android app</a> and will see what comes next. If you are tired of waiting for a native client, check out the <a href="faq.html#a5">F.A.Q.</a></p>
