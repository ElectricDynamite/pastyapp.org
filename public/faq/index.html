      <h2>The Answers (and also the questions again)</h2>
      
      <a name="a0">&nbsp;</a><h3>What is Pasty?</h3>
<p>Pasty is a collection of applications that, in total, provide a cloud-based clipboard service to help you easily share short snippets across your different devices.
And it&rsquo;s completely free! Take a look at <a href="/">About Pasty</a> for more infos.</p>

      
      <a name="a1">&nbsp;</a><h3>Why is it free?</h3>
<p>It is free because I believe that charging money for services that often get provided by others for &ldquo;free&rdquo; rarely succeeds. However, with most things you pay in some way, usually it is your data and your privacy. With Pasty, it is not you who pays for it, neither with data nor with money. It is me that pays for it, since it is a hobby of mine. You&rsquo;re welcome ;-)</p>

      
      <a name="a2">&nbsp;</a><h3>What about my data, do you make money using my data?</h3>
<p>Nope. I dislike services that make money using their users data. Just because I offer you a service to transfer data for you does not mean I have any rights to that data. It&rsquo;s yours, and it stays that way.</p>

      
      <a name="a3">&nbsp;</a><h3>What clients are there?</h3>
<p>Currently there is a native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.electricdynamite.pasty">Android app</a> and a <a href="https://pasty.cc/">Web App</a>. I will most likely not build additional clients for lack of time, but Pasty has an open API, so third party clients are always an option.</p>

      
      <a name="a4">&nbsp;</a><h3>When will client xyz be released?</h3>
<p>I will likely not build additional native clients. But Pasty&rsquo;s API is open, so if you are somebody or know somebody that knows how to code, check out <a href="#6">« I am a developer and want a client for xyz.»</a>.</p>

      
      <a name="a5">&nbsp;</a><h3>I am a developer and want a client for xyz.</h3>
<p>First of all, that&rsquo;s not a question. Ha, I know, I wrote it myself and now act as if it is your fault. Isn&rsquo;t that funny?
But enough of teh funnehs, let&rsquo;s get to business. Pasty&rsquo;s API is open, so if you REALLY want that client, why don&rsquo;t you go ahead and write it yourself?
Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite/pasty-server/wiki">Wiki pages on Github</a>, mostly the <a href="https://github.com/ElectricDynamite/pasty-server/wiki/REST-API">REST API</a>.</p>

      
      <a name="a6">&nbsp;</a><h3>Is Pasty Open Source?</h3>
<p>Some parts are, some parts aren&rsquo;t. It is meant to be, but I never got around to doing it properly. So&hellip; soon?</p>

      
      <a name="a7">&nbsp;</a><h3>How do magnets work?</h3>
<p>Please see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism">Wikipedia:Magnetism</a></p>
